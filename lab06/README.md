# Fifteen Puzzle Game

A classic sliding puzzle implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is created for educational purposes during my bachelor degree, to practice front-end web development skills.

## Description

The Fifteen Puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The goal is to place the tiles in numerical order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.

This implementation features:
- A 4x4 grid of sliding tiles
- Numbered tiles from 1 to 15
- Visual feedback for movable tiles
- A shuffle button to randomize the puzzle
- Win detection that alerts the player upon successful completion
- Background image implementation for visual appeal

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (with Prototype.js library)
- DOM Manipulation
- Event Handling

## Learning Objectives

This project serves as a practical exercise for:
- JavaScript DOM manipulation
- CSS positioning and styling
- Event handling in JavaScript
- Game logic implementation
- Frontend development best practices

## Features

- Interactive tile movement
- Visual highlighting of movable tiles
- Random puzzle shuffling
- Win condition detection
- Responsive design
- Background image implementation for tiles

## How to Play

1. The puzzle starts in a solved state with tiles 1-15 in order
2. Click the "Shuffle" button to randomize the tiles
3. Click on any tile adjacent to the empty space to move it
4. Continue moving tiles until they are in numerical order with the empty space in the bottom right corner
5. The game will alert you when you've won!

## Educational Notes

This project was created as a learning exercise and demonstrates several important concepts in web development:
- Absolute positioning in CSS
- Dynamic style manipulation
- Event listener implementation
- Game state management
- Algorithm implementation for shuffle and win detection
