# Sudoku Web Game

A web-based Sudoku game implementation created as a final exam project for Web Technologies course, during my bachelor degree. This project combines and showcases various web development concepts learned throughout the course.

## Project Overview

This application is a full-featured Sudoku game that includes:

* User authentication system with registration and secure login functionality
* Multiple difficulty levels to challenge players of all skill levels
* Comprehensive score tracking and global rankings system
* Convenient pause/resume functionality for interrupted gameplay
* Accurate timer tracking to measure performance
* Fully responsive design that works across all devices

## Technical Details

The project leverages the following technologies:

* PHP for backend logic and user management
* MySQL for data persistence
* JavaScript/AJAX for dynamic interactions
* CSS for styling and responsive design
* Prototype.js library for enhanced JavaScript functionality
* Scriptaculous 1.9.0 library for animations (used to animate the Sudoku table when invalid moves are made)

## Key Features

### Core Game Logic

The most challenging and interesting aspect of this project was developing the algorithm that generates valid Sudoku puzzles. The algorithm:

* Creates a complete, valid Sudoku grid
* Removes numbers based on the selected difficulty level
* Ensures the puzzle remains solvable
* Validates user inputs in real-time

### User System

* User registration and authentication
* Score tracking across different difficulty levels
* Global rankings system
* Personal statistics

### Game Features

* Three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
* Save/load game state
* Pause functionality
* Timer tracking
* Input validation
* Visual feedback for errors with animations
* Animated shake effect when an invalid solution is submitted

## Purpose

This project was created as a final exam evaluation for a Web Technologies course. It demonstrates the practical application of various web development concepts including:

* Front-end development
* Back-end programming
* Database design and management
* User authentication
* AJAX interactions
* Responsive design principles

The project successfully combines these elements into a cohesive, fully-functional web application while showcasing problem-solving skills through the implementation of complex game logic.

## About the Project

This project served as a comprehensive way to put together all the knowledge acquired from previous Web Technologies exercises. 
The most challenging and interesting aspect was developing the algorithm that generates and fills the Sudoku grid - a task that required careful consideration of game rules and optimization for performance.
This exercise was completed as part of the final exam evaluation for the Web Technologies course.
